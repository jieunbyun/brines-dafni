  summary: >
    - Assesses surplus in energy demand after wind and solar generation (0 if demands are met solely by wind and solar)
    - Surplus is evaluated by Monte Carlo Simulation of wind and solar generation and demands
  description: >
    BRINES is a computational model that performs Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) to assess surplus energy demand after accounting for wind and solar generation, with a surplus of 0 indicating that renewable sources fully meet the demand. 

    Using climate simulation data, BRINES generates MCS samples of wind and solar generation alongside energy demand. The model is designed for applications in renewable energy infrastructure planning and climate change impact assessment.

    The model can be used to simulate the impacts of different infrastructure configurations on the distribution of demand surplus. It can also be used to simulate the impacts of climate change scenarios.
